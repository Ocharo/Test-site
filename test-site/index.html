        <h1>Hatua Network of Libraries</h1>
            <p>Two central libraries make up the Hatua Network of Libraries; 
                one is located in the Likoni Constituency and the other in the Nyali Constituency. <br />There are nine satellite libraries spread around Mombasa County.
                Our public schools Shikaadabu, Vyemani, Peleleza, Sacred Heart, 
                Serani, Mbheni, Makupa, Ronald Ngala, 
                and Tudor all have satellite libraries</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Mombasa’s public schools are overcrowded and under-resourced, 
            limiting the individual attention teachers pay to students,
             and resulting in fewer than half of students reading at grade level. 
             This situation is compounded for low income families that cannot afford textbooks and often live in a single room, 
             sometimes without electricity. <br />This leaves students with no books,
              and limited space to study, while forcing Mombasa’s poorest 
              children to read by candlelight.
               Girls are often disproportionately burdened with childcare 
               and chores at home, 
               leaving them with less time to study.</p>
